          "explanation": "Algebra is the branch of mathematics that uses letters (variables) to represent unknown values. In this unit, we learn how to use variables to write expressions and equations that help us solve real-world problems.",
          "examples": [
            "If x represents a number, then x + 5 represents 5 more than that number.",
            "The equation 2x = 10 means we need to find the value of x such that 2 times x equals 10. The answer is x = 5.",

          "explanation": "A linear equation is an equation where the highest power of the variable is 1. We solve linear equations by performing the same operation on both sides until we isolate the variable.",
          "examples": [
            "Solve: 3x + 5 = 14. First subtract 5 from both sides: 3x = 9. Then divide both sides by 3: x = 3.",
