          "name": "speed_velocity_acceleration",
          "description": "Understanding motion parameters",
          "difficulty": "beginner",
          "estimatedTime": 150,
          "explanation": "Speed measures how fast an object is moving (distance/time). Velocity includes both speed and direction. Acceleration measures how quickly velocity changes. These are fundamental concepts in studying motion.",
          "examples": [
            "A car travels 100 km in 2 hours. Its speed is 100/2 = 50 km/h.",
            "If the car is moving at 50 km/h towards the north, its velocity is 50 km/h north.",
            "If the car speeds up from 50 km/h to 80 km/h in 10 seconds, it has positive acceleration."
          ],
          "objectives": [
            "Define speed, velocity, and acceleration",

          "difficulty": "intermediate",
          "estimatedTime": 180,
          "explanation": "The equations of motion relate the five kinematic variables: initial velocity (u), final velocity (v), acceleration (a), time (t), and displacement (s). These equations allow us to solve complex motion problems.",
          "examples": [
            "v = u + at (velocity equation)",
            "s = ut + ½at² (displacement equation)",
            "v² = u² + 2as (velocity-displacement relation)",
            "A car starts from rest (u=0) and accelerates at 2 m/s² for 5 seconds. Final velocity: v = 0 + 2(5) = 10 m/s"

          "difficulty": "advanced",
          "estimatedTime": 200,
          "explanation": "Free fall is motion under the influence of gravity alone, with acceleration g = 9.8 m/s² downward. Projectile motion is motion under gravity with an initial horizontal velocity component.",
          "examples": [
            "An object dropped from 100m height. Using s = ½gt², we find time = √(2×100/9.8) ≈ 4.5 seconds.",
            "A ball thrown horizontally from a 50m building lands 100m away. We can calculate initial velocity and flight time.",

          "difficulty": "beginner",
          "estimatedTime": 120,
          "explanation": "Newton's First Law states that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force. This is called inertia - the resistance of an object to change its state of motion.",
          "examples": [
            "A book on a table stays there because no force is pushing it.",
            "A car moving at constant velocity continues moving unless the brakes (external force) are applied.",
            "In space with no gravity or friction, an object would move forever at constant velocity."

          "estimatedTime": 160,
          "explanation": "Newton's Second Law relates force, mass, and acceleration: F = ma. A net force applied to an object causes acceleration proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the mass.",
          "examples": [
            "A 2 kg object with 10 N force applied: a = F/m = 10/2 = 5 m/s²",
            "Doubling the force doubles the acceleration.",
            "Doubling the mass halves the acceleration.",
